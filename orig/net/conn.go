	// SetDeadline sets the read and write deadlines associated

	// SetReadDeadline and SetWriteDeadline.
	//
	// A deadline is an absolute time after which I/O operations
	// fail instead of blocking. The deadline applies to all future
	// and pending I/O, not just the immediately following call to
	// Read or Write. After a deadline has been exceeded, the
	// connection can be refreshed by setting a deadline in the future.
	//
	// If the deadline is exceeded a call to Read or Write or to other
	// I/O methods will return an error that wraps os.ErrDeadlineExceeded.
	// This can be tested using errors.Is(err, os.ErrDeadlineExceeded).
	// The error's Timeout method will return true, but note that there
	// are other possible errors for which the Timeout method will
	// return true even if the deadline has not been exceeded.
	//
	// An idle timeout can be implemented by repeatedly extending
	// the deadline after successful Read or Write calls.
	//
	// A zero value for t means I/O operations will not time out.

	// SetReadDeadline sets the deadline for future Read calls
	// and any currently-blocked Read call.
	// A zero value for t means Read will not time out.
	SetReadDeadline(t time.Time) error

	// SetWriteDeadline sets the deadline for future Write calls
	// and any currently-blocked Write call.
	// Even if write times out, it may return n > 0, indicating that
	// some of the data was successfully written.
	// A zero value for t means Write will not time out.
